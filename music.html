                        <br>
                        Who could ever see?<br>
                        We can I know<br>
                        Memory<br>
                        Can it be?<br>
                        Angles in the wind<br>
                        <br>
                        Just geometry of shapes related to 1<br>
                        In the oceans of our dreams<br>
                        Rolling round the turnstile<br>
                        Lost in the noise<br>
                        <br>
                        Calculating mass<br>
                        Growing older<br>
                        Day by day begin to <br>
                        Go and stay<br>
                        Baskets filled with rain<br>
                        <br>
                        Just geometry of shapes related to 1<br>
                        In the oceans of our dreams<br>
                        Rolling round the turnstile<br>
                        Lost in the noise<br>
                        <br>
                        From the time that field flipped over<br>
                        All the people of the valleys searching for<br>
                        Another version of the old-time lover<br>
                        Hidden by the stories of control<br>
                        Of the things within our grasp<br>
                        <br>
                        Don’t get caught up in the war<br>
                        Dissonance mutes, harmony expands<br>
                        Just like the forest shows<br>
                        Don’t get caught up in the war<br>
                        Not every moment is grand<br>
                        It’s just one turn though, from every angle<br>
                        Don’t get caught up in the war<br>
                        Dissonance mutes, harmony expands<br>
                        Just like the garden shows<br>
                        <br>
                        Just like the garden shows so well<br>
                        A space for each layer in the sun<br>
                        A signal that bounces off the<br>
                        Walls of the memory<br>
                        Just like a ripple in the skull<br>
                        A chamber that grows and holds us all<br>
                        A seed that can sprout into all<br>

                        <br>
                        here in this moment of our lives<br>
                        when the public’s getting iced<br>
                        faster than yesteryear<br>
                        exploitation, in complacence<br>
                        hiding from the war they’re lighting<br>
                        everybody acts like it’s alright<br>
                        just as long as we feel fine<br>
                        <br>
                        can we find a way<br>
                        to uncover the charade<br>
                        faster than yesteryear<br>
                        education, in engagement<br>
                        integrate with truth<br>
                        many choices lead away from<br>
                        learning what’s real in this world<br>
                        <br>
                        just at the first glimpse of the light<br>
                        all the cities would ignite<br>
                        learning what’s real at last<br>
                        fountain’s defaced, people misplaced<br>
                        many seeds and stones<br>
                        talking with such words undefined<br>
                        <br>
                        won’t admit that time<br>
                        is part of the world<br>
                        run it again<br>
                        you’ll see the same old swirl<br>
                        <br>
                        rush for the market if your<br>
                        habitat is dead<br>
                        inflatable bank points so the<br>
                        public just gets bread and circus<br>
                        <br>
                        but what market are you making<br>
                        when water sinks lower down<br>
                        and the Earth skin is deflating<br>
                        leaking catastrophe<br>
                        unborn children getting poorer<br>
                        no opportunity<br>
                        crazy lazy liars hazing<br>
                        desperate prisoners<br>
                        <br>
                        maybe, maybe one day lately<br>
                        starting to stir awake<br>
                        all it takes to clear the fountain<br>
                        is broad attention<br>
